Tutorial 1 - Eye tracking
=========================

In this first example we are going to do some eye tracking using the hough tracking method. This is probably
not the most common particle tracking case but it makes a good introduction to the software since the number
of particles is small and it is easy to see what is happening. We will describe 
this simple example in quite a lot of detail. Later examples will build on each other so 
it may be worth doing this even if you think you are unlikely to want to track eyes or even use the Hough Circles algorithm.

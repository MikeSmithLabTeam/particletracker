Tutorial 2 - Diffusing colloids with trackpy
============================================

In this example we are going to use an existing python based particle tracking code known as trackpy. 
The details of this project can be found here (http://soft-matter.github.io/trackpy/v0.4.2/). Although
there are other feature finding (tracking) algorithms in this software the trackpy project is 
used in linking these features for all the different algorithms. You should therefore cite this project
in any publications regardless of whether you used the trackpy "track" algorithm.

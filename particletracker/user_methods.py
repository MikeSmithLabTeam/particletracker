'''
All methods created in this file will be automatically imported into the different 
method sections of the software. If you want to extend the functionality add
to this file and then make a backup somewhere separate. Then in the future 
you can update the software and simply replace this file. We provide templates
below for adding to the software in each section. You should also back up the 
parameters dictionary function which is located in general.param_file_creator.py

To add an method you must create a method and add the @error_handling decorator. 
Note this has changed recently and means you no longer need the custom exception 
The methods in a given section all take the same inputs and outputs.

    Tracking methods such as Hough Circles or Contours have an option called get_intensities.
    In order to use a get_intensities_method you enter the name of the function directly into 
    the gui. This sends a small image bounding one particle which has been masked so that only
    the pixels inside the contour or circle are visible. You can then perform any calculation
    you want on these pixels. These functions return a single value which is stored in the 
    dataframe for each particle. You could perhaps want to analyse the stress on a particle made of
    birefringent material by analysing the intensity pattern. You'd therefore calculate the stress
    and return this value.

    Inputs:
        masked_img  :   a masked image cropped tightly around a single particle.
